## Accepted Topics

###

* **Session Title**: Empathy as a Service: Supporting Mental Health in the Tech Workplace
* **Preferred Timeframe**: July (anytime after July 18)
* **Event Type**: 50-min Lecture
* **Summary**: 1 in 5 Americans are living with a mental illness such as depression, bipolar, anxiety, or ADHD. As a community, the single most damaging thing we can do is perpetuate the stigma against mental disorders. This talk will begin with an overview of key statistics about mental wellness, followed by the efforts of the non-profit organization [Open Sourcing Mental Illness](https://osmihelp.org) to gather more data about mental health in the tech industry, the ALGEE action plan taught by the [Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/) training course, and finally conclude with ideas and strategies for making our tech workplaces more accommodating and inclusive.

* **Session Title**:  So You Want To Go Faster? 
* **Preferred Timeframe**: August 1st (or sometime that week) 
* **Event Type**: 50-min Lecture
* **Summary**: How frequently does a good agile team deploy to production? Not every team is capable of deploying "on every commit". What does it take for a team to even start deploying at the end of each sprint, or each week, or each day?

Most companies don't realize that deploying more frequently often requires both significant technical change as well as cultural change. In this talk, I'll guide you through what it takes to deploy more frequently, both from the technical side of setting up pipelines as well as the organizational side of removing red tape. I'll draw on the unique challenges that teams must overcome at each step of the way, from deploying once a month all the way down to full continuous delivery. If your team has been struggling to go faster, come see how you can change to get there.

* **Session Title**: Here's What's Trending In Software Engineering
* **Preferred Timeframe**: Any weeknight
* **Event Type**: Lightning Talk (~30 minutes with questions)
* **Summary**: One of the great things about working in software engineering is all the new technology that pops up every day. So many new options are arriving on the open-source and commercial landscapes that give us levels of productivity, functionality, performance, and security we‚Äôve never enjoyed before. Then again, constantly changing technology is also one of the intimidating things about working in software engineering. This talk will explore major trends in software engineering you should know so you can be prepared for what‚Äôs coming, and in some cases what‚Äôs already here, and evaluate how they can add value to your current projects.

* **Session Title**: Taming and Composing High Performance Stream-Oriented Processing
* **Preferred Timeframe**: Any weeknight
* **Event Type**: 50 mins / 1 hour Lecture
* **Summary**: Real time applications are dominating the industry! Data is the main ingredient in Internet-based, social media and Internet of things (IoT) systems, which generate continuous streams of events used for real time analytics. This poses a tremendous challenge due to the massive volume of data collected and processed. These event-based Real-time analysis systems can easily process millions of messages per second through new generation solutions by simply defining small flows and then combining them together to create processing graphs. In this talk, will cover the concepts behind high-performance streamed-oriented big data processing systems. We will explore messaging queue systems like Kafka and Akka Streams which let developers define their process workflows at a higher level to define a graph system enabling a high throughput. You will learn how to integrate high performance stream message queues and how to define process workflows in C# and F#.
